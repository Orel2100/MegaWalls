*   **Items:**
    *   Golden Helmet (dyed blue)
    *   Golden Chestplate (dyed blue)
    *   Golden Leggings (dyed blue)
    *   Golden Boots (dyed blue)

## 2. Golem Kit

*   **Description:** A tanky front-line fighter made of iron.
*   **Items:**
    *   Iron Helmet
    *   Iron Chestplate
    *   Iron Leggings
    *   Iron Boots
    *   Iron Sword
*   **Skills:**
    *   **Iron Skin (Active):** Gain Resistance II and Slowness I for 5 seconds.
        *   **XP Cost:** 100
    *   **Unstoppable (Passive):** Immune to knockback.
*   **Balancing:** The Golem is very tanky but slow. The `Iron Skin` ability makes it even harder to kill, but the slowness effect makes it vulnerable to kiting. The knockback immunity makes it a formidable opponent in close quarters.

## 3. Assassin Kit

*   **Items:**
    *   Leather Helmet (dyed black)
    *   Leather Chestplate (dyed black)

        *   **XP Cost:** 120
    *   **Backstab (Passive):** Deal double damage when attacking an enemy from behind.
*   **Balancing:** The Assassin is a high-risk, high-reward kit. It has low defense but high damage potential. The `Vanish` skill allows for surprise attacks and escapes, but it has a high XP cost. The `Backstab` passive rewards skillful positioning.
